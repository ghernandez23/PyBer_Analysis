# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The objective of this analysis is to review data obtained by PyBer to display the disparaties in the differnt city types for their business and to show this information to decision makers at PyBer to determine how they can continue to grow their business

## Results
I was asked to obtain the same information for each city type (Urban, Suburban and Rural) to show total rides, total drivers, total fares, the average fare per driver and city type:

Urban cities- Per my analysis of urban cities, there was a total of 1625 total rides, 2405 total drivers for PyBer and 39854.38 in total fares. The average fare per ride is 24.53 and the average fare per driver is 16.57

Suburban cities- Per my analysis of suburban cities, there was a total of 625 total rides, 490 total drivers and 19356.33 in total fares. The average fare per ride is 30.97 and the average fare per driver is 39.50

Rural cities- Per my analysis of rural cities, there was a total of 125 total rides, 78 total drivers and 4327.93 in total fares. The average fare per ride is 34.62 and the average fare per driver is 55.49

## Summary
Based on the information obtained, there is some positives as well as negatives for both drivers and riders in each city type. While urban cities tend to have the most in total rides/total fares, the average driver is making substancially less per ride compared to suburban and rural cities. With rural cities, their drivers make the most per ride but have less than 10 percent of urban cities total rides and less than 25 percent of suburban cities total rides. Based on all the information obtained, here are my suggestions for each city type

1. Urban cities should have additional incentives in place to continue to motivate drivers in the area due to the low amount of money they make per fare. I would suggest offering bonuses to drivers who hit x amount of fares per week to make up for the lower fares per ride. 
2. Suburban cities is where more focus needs to be on marketing for additional business. They are flooded with drivers, but not nearly as many people using PyBer for their ride sharing needs. By putting more focus on advertising and incentivizing new customers with introduction discounts and existing customers with periodic ones as well I believe this will help address the disparity in total rides/drivers.
3. Rural cities is going to be tough due to the lack of users and longer distances. While rural city drivers make the most per fare, there just isnt enough business to go around with only 125 total rides in the given period of time. I believe these drivers need to be treated as W2 employees with weekly/bi weekly income salaries that are guarenteed. Without some sort of guarentee for the employees in this area, I do not see PyBer being able to offer their services to riders in these cities.
